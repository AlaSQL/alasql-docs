# AlaSQL documentation

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/AlaSQL/alasql-docs.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Lets make the documentation better. 

Just a test site at the moment...'

Auto-publishing to [alasql.surge.sh](http://alasql.surge.sh) at the moment.

### Notes

Interesting things for future improvements (as offline docs):

- `grip` from pip to make github md->html
- `wget64` from npm to include all resurses into one html
- `shx` from npm for cross platform bash opperations
